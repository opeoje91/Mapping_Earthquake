# Mapping_Earthquake

## Earthquake_Challenge

### Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to tell stories about the disasters around the world using data visualization.

### Overview

I built interactive features on Earthquakes from around the world, using the latest Earthquake geoJSON data.

Using javaScript, d3 and Leaflet libraries, I traversed and retrieved data

Plotted data on Mapbox map through API request

The magnitude of Earthquake was shown using Popup Markers

Relationships between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates were also shown with multiple layers of maps
